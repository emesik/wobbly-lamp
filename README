wobbly lamp

Lamp which reacts to movement by changing colors.

It associates red, green and blue components with X, Y and Z axes respectively. The deflection from
initial position is linearly converted to light volume in each axis and returns to normal with
decay adjustable by a potentiometer unless the lamp gets bumped again.

Hardware required:
	* 12V supply,
	* MMA7361 accelerometer breakout board,
	* RGB LED strip or other similar light source with common anode,
	* 50x50mm single layer board to make the PCB,
	* electronic components as listed in the KiCad project (ATmega8, 3Ã—N-FET, 3V3 regulator and
	  a bunch of resistors, capacitors and connectors),

This project aims to be an example of ATmega MCU's use of:
	* PWM (pulse width modulation),
	* ADC (analog to digital conversion),
	* interrupts (timer and ADC),
