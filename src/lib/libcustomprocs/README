libcustomprocs: custom procedures for AVR MCUs - v1.1.0

Author: Philippe Proulx (eeppeliteloop@gmail.com) - <http://eepp.ca/>
Released: January 17th, 2011


1 DESCRIPTION

This library features a few useful procedures. Most of them are related to
string manipulation as of this version.


2 CONFIGURATION

The following variable have to be defined in the shipped Makefile:

	* MCU: your AVR MCU (e.g. "atmega16")
	* F_CPU: your MCU physical clock frequency (e.g. "8000000UL")


3 DOCUMENTATION

Refer to header file "customprocs.h" for a description of functions arguments
and what they actually do.

Since the library uses AVR Libc busy-wait delays, you have to define F_CPU
to the AVR MCU's clock frequency (Hz). A common way of doing this is defining
it within the command-line, when calling GCC. For example, an 8,000,000 Hz
MCU yields the following C flag:

	-DF_CPU=8000000UL

The "UL" suffix is important here since we are dealing with some big litteral.
This is what is done in the shipped Makefile.
